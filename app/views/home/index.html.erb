	THE PLEDGE: I pledge that if at any moment Bernie is no longer a candidate in the Democratic party, either by concession, or denial of the nomination at the convention, I will immediately change my registration to the Green Party. 
	<br><br>
	After completing the pledge, let us each find ten other Bernie or Busters to take the pledge as well. As we work to find others in our community, we will show our unity, and have evidence of our numbers.
	<br><br>
	THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE GREEN PARTY! 
	<br><br>
	This is a campaign to unify our voices in a way that empowers us to transform our government. We know that the two party system has not been working for the people, and that a multiparty system will benefit the nation. Establishing any new party would position all other parties and independent candidates to have successful campaigns in all legs of the government in the future.
	<br><br>
	As more of us take the pledge, we will increase our confidence to vote third party, and encourage Sanders to stay in the race if denied the Democratic nomination.
